The text in the image comes from the video game Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. It says:

"The right thing... What is it? I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody... happy?"

Below the quote, it mentions Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. There's also a triangular symbol at the top with the number 1 inside it. This quote reflects the deep, philosophical undertones the game is known for. Are you a fan of the series?
