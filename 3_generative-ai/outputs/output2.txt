Certainly! This image contains a quote from Dune Messiah by Frank Herbert. The text reads:

"Do not compete with what is happening. To compete is to prepare for failure. Do not be trapped by the need to achieve anything. This way, you achieve everything." â€”Hayt/Duncan Idaho, Dune Messiah

The visual portrays figures traversing a dramatic desert landscape. A central character wields a weapon and dons a flowing cloak, while the backdrop features a glowing sun amidst a swirling sandstorm. It's quite evocative, capturing the stark, unforgiving atmosphere of the Dune series. Are you a fan of the series or exploring it for the first time?
