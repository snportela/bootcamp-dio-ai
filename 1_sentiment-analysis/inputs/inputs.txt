- Videogame review

Stardew Valley is not only the best farming game I’ve played, it is one of my favorite games of all time. That myself and others keep returning to this eight-year old gem each time it gets even the smallest update speaks to how it’s truly a masterpiece in the genre it both reinvigorated and has come to define. It is chock-full of bizarre and memorable characters, moments, and conversations, not to mention a neverending to-do list that fuels the completionist in me. It’s also an intensely strategic adventure, using its cozy farming activities and cute pixel art to make the deeply engaging time management challenge underneath it all effortlessly inviting. Stardew Valley has earned a spot on your platform of choice as a modern classic, standing proudly alongside gaming’s all-time greats. I’ve played countless hours already and will surely play countless more, because every time I boot it up, it feels like coming home.

- TV Show Review

Daredevil returns to form with a pair of superb episodes that show precisely what makes the character tick, whether he’s a civilian or a costumed crusader. The bank-robbery episode is an unexpected delight full of creative storytelling and fresh ideas. The wait for Daredevil to show up again has been a long one, but I dare say it was all worth it. These episodes do have a few characteristically “MCU” quality issues between the ill-placed humor and the ill-executed CGI, but those are small problems in what’s otherwise a big win for Daredevil: Born Again.
